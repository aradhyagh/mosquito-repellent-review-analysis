So after more than a week of using two of it,the darkish one too,i would say its working out fine.And i tell you i am from manipur and mosquitos and all kinds insects are famous over here.If i gave a 5 star review that means its working fine.

RTL,2.0,Disappointed with the Product Mismatch,29 March 2024,"I recently purchased the Good Night Refill (60 Nights Jumbo Refill) pack of 4 from Amazon, and unfortunately, I am disappointed with the product I received. The item did not match the description provided, as I received a regular Good Night Refill instead of the 60-night Jumbo refill version I had ordered.

Firstly, the reason I opted for the 60-night refill was because of its longevity, ensuring uninterrupted peaceful nights for an extended period. However, to my dismay, the refill I received only lasted for a customary duration, just like any regular refill. This discrepancy is a letdown, as specifically stated in the description should have been honored.

Moreover, the misrepresentation of the product has caused inconveniences and disappointment.
Although the regular Good Night Refill performs adequately, it falls short in meeting my expectations set by the description and my initial purchase decision. The miscommunication has caused me unnecessary inconvenience, which truly undermines the shopping experience I had anticipated.

Despite this setback, I would like to acknowledge the prompt delivery and general quality of the product, and the packaging was intact upon arrival. However, this still does not compensate for the inaccurate product information and inconveniences faced.

In light of the above, I urge your team to update the product description and ensure accuracy in the future. As a customer, it is disheartening to receive a product that does not match the described features, leading to frustration and regret.

I sincerely hope that this issue is remedied promptly and that other customers do not encounter similar problems.

However while removing from the machine I've observed that liquid is spilling from the refill, immediately I've checked other refills in the box and all are same. The nozzle isn't properly sealed for these. But well done for single packs.

Will update the review after using one of these.

It is very good quality product which I got in on approx 22% discount. I have searched in whole market, no one is giving so much discount. It works perfectly on mosquitoes. If u put this on in active mode then no mosquito would sting u. Fragrance is also good. In normal mode it doesn't work perfectly on mosquitoes, there is a lot of possibility that mosquitoes can sting u. Only drawback is that it doesn't fit in latest Gold Flash machine. It fits only in Active+ machine.
